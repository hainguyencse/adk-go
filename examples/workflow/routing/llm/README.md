# LLM-driven routing sample

The smallest sample that uses an actual LLM as the routing brain inside a workflow graph. An `LlmAgent` classifies the user's message into one of three categories; a trivial Go function then emits the corresponding `Event.Routes` value, dispatching to one of three handlers.

- **Concept:** LLM classifies, a plain function emits the route, the engine dispatches (`NewAgentNode` + `StringRoute`).
- **Needs LLM?** Yes (Gemini)

Same shape as adk-python's `contributing/workflow_samples/route/` sample (LLM classifier + plain function emitting the routing event). For the non-LLM version, see [`../string`](../string).

## Goal

Show the canonical "LLM as the brain, engine does the routing" pattern: keep the LLM stateless about routing and keep the routing logic in plain code. The classifier returns one word; the router turns that into an `Event.Routes` value; three `StringRoute` edges dispatch to the matching handler.

## Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    User[User]
    subgraph "ADK Application Workflow"
        Start((Start)) --> C[Agent Node: classify LLM]
        C --> R{Node: route_by_classification}
        R -- "question" --> Q[Node: answer_question]
        R -- "statement" --> S[Node: comment_statement]
        R -- "exclamation" --> E[Node: react_exclamation]
        Q --> End((End))
        S --> End
        E --> End
    end
    User -- "1. What time is it?" --> Start
    End -- "2. answering question: What time is it?" --> User
```

## Running the sample

```bash
go run ./examples/workflow/routing/llm/ console
```

## Example session

```text
User -> What time is it?
Agent -> question
answering question: What time is it?

User -> Hello world!
Agent -> exclamation
reacting to exclamation: Hello world!

User -> The sky is blue.
Agent -> statement
commenting on statement: The sky is blue.
```

The first line of agent output is the LLM's classification (it prints because the console launcher streams every event with text content). The second line is the handler's reply.

## What it shows

| Concept | Where |
|---|---|
| `workflow.NewAgentNode` wrapping an `LLMAgent` | `classifyNode := workflow.NewAgentNode(classifier, ...)` |
| LLM reply flowing to the next node | `AgentNode` synthesizes the classifier's final reply into `Event.Output`, which the scheduler feeds to the router as input; `LLMAgent.OutputKey = "output"` is optional here and only persists the reply to session state |
| Custom `BaseNode` translating the LLM's free-form text into a route value | `route_by_classification` reads the classifier's reply, normalises it, and emits `Event.Routes` |
| `StringRoute` matching one of three categories | three downstream edges, one per category |
| Handler reading the original user message from `ctx.UserContent` | each handler calls `userMessage(ctx)` rather than receiving it as graph input — the routing node only forwards the classification, not the original text |

## Notes

### Why two nodes (classifier + router)?

Mirrors the canonical adk-python pattern: keep the LLM stateless about routing, keep the routing logic in plain code. The alternative — one custom node that calls the LLM and emits `Routes` from the same Run body — is shorter but mixes "LLM-driven decision" with "graph wiring", and reuses none of the engine's normal LLMAgent machinery (output_key, telemetry, etc.).

### Why register the classifier in `Config.SubAgents`?

`workflow.NewAgentNode` wraps an `agent.Agent` for graph execution but does **not** make that agent visible in the runner's agent tree (the structure `runner.findAgentToRun` walks to resolve `event.Author` to an `agent.Agent`). Without the explicit `SubAgents: []agent.Agent{classifier}` registration, the runner logs

```
Event from an unknown agent: classify, event id: ...
```

on every turn. The warning is harmless — the runner falls back to `rootAgent` (the workflow itself), and `isTransferableAcrossAgentTree` blocks any actual re-routing to the LLM agent because the chain to root contains a non-LLMAgent (the workflow wrapper). But registering the classifier as a sub-agent silences the warning and keeps the agent tree consistent with the workflow graph. Treat it as required boilerplate for any workflow that wraps a sub-agent.

### Tunable: pick a different model

Edit `gemini-flash-latest` in `main.go` to whatever model your key has access to. The classifier prompt is very short and any modern Gemini model handles it.
